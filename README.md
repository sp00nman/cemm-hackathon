cemm-hackathon
==============

A repository to collect ideas, code &amp; figures developed during CeMM hackathons.


# Repository organization

I propose we organize the repository with individual directories for each hackaton: `hackatons/<date>`, where `<date>` is in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

Common things to all hackatons can still have folders in the root of the repository.
