Git, Markdown and Github
========================

**Making CeMM a git-powered institute**

30th of March, 2015 - Level 5 meeting room.

----------

The current increase in demand for both computational skills in biology and reproducibility in research, imposes challenges in the way research projects are conducted, and its methods and results are stored and shared. 

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) as a technology has the power to provide control of project changes, collaborative editing, and with technologies built on top of git, sharing projects and learning with them is made possible with [love, Internet style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe1TZaElTAs).


# Tentative program
1. Introduction to version control and git
2. Introduction to Markdown
3. Overview of Github's features (issues, wiki, Github pages, organizations, gists)
4. Playing with git and Github (30 min hands-on)
5. Git and Markdown for collaborative research (workflow)
6. Using git CeMM-wide
    + Proposal
    + Discussion

### Hands-on
#### Setup
Depending on the experience of the attendees these steps might need to be done initially:

1. Set up git
2. Create Github account + add keys
3. Join CeMM team
4. Get a text editor

#### Experimenting
Depending on the number and experience of the attendees we can have several activities (individual or in groups):
+ Contribute to a tutorial (`cemm-vienna/tutorials`) on:
    + "introduction to programming" (*e.g.* unix commands tips, project organization, bioinformatics file types)
    + bioinformatic workflows (*e.g.* practical principles of read alignment, variant calling, transcriptome assembly, epigenome data processing)
    + basic plotting tutorial (*e.g.* R introduction, ggplot, matplotlib)
+ Converting a own-existing project into a repository and upload it to Github (personal/private accounts for now)
+ ...


**Note**:
+ The tutorials would be a one-page markdown document that becomes part of the tutorials wiki.
+ **The goal** is not to have a very detailed and polished document, but **to experiment with git** in the process. It can be finished later.
+ For many things it could be simply a gathering of existing resources, rather than rewriting stuff, or a prototypical example of a task so people that already have this could simply make a markdown document with it.

## Markdown

Markdown has many flavors (versions). If interested, you can read [here](http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-flavored-markdown/) and [here](http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-markdown-is-now-common-markdown/) about the struggles of unifying Markdown.

Right now, the most "standard" flavor of Markdown is [Common Markdown](http://commonmark.org/), so it'd be good to have that as reference, although in practice it shouldn't matter that much.
