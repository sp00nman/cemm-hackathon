Git, Markdown and Github
========================

**Making CeMM a git-powered institute**

30th of March, 2015 - Level 5 meeting room.

----------

The current increase in demand for both computational skills in biology and reproducibility in research, imposes challenges in the way research projects are conducted, and its methods and results are stored and shared. 

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) as a technology has the power to provide control of project changes, collaborative editing, and with technologies built on top of git, sharing projects and learning with them is made possible with [love, Internet style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe1TZaElTAs).

Markdown has many flavors (versions). If interested, you can read [here](http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-flavored-markdown/) and [here](http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-markdown-is-now-common-markdown/) about the struggles of unifying Markdown.

Right now, the most "standard" flavor of Markdown is [Common Markdown](http://commonmark.org/), so it'd be good to have that as reference, although in practice it shouldn't matter that much.
